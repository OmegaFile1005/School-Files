// Susan is hired for a job, and her employer agrees to pay her every day.Her employer also agrees that Susanâ€™s salary is 1 penny on the first day, 2 pennies on the second day, and 4 pennies on the third day, continuing to double each day.Create a program that allows the user to enter the number of days that Susan will work and calculates the total amount of pay she will receive over that period of time.
// the value must start as 1 then multiply by 2 and add the previous value.
