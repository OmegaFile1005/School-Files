<p>Twelve-year-old <u>Percy Jackson</u> is on the most <i><b>dangerous</b></i> quest of his life. With the help of a satyr and a daughter of <u>Athena</u>, <u>Percy</u> must journey across the United States to catch a thief who has stolen the <i><b>original</b></i> weapon of mass destruction — <u>Zeus’</u> master bolt. Along the way, he must face a host of <i><b>mythological</b></i> enemies determined to stop him. Most of all, he must come to terms with a father he has never known, and an Oracle that has warned him of betrayal by a friend. The Lightning Thief by <u>Rick Riordan</u>.</p>
