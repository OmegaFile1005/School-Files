    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2017</p>
    <p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide.</i> In <i>sous
            vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is
        precisely set to the target temperature ofthe food. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes
        it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef
        table, contact us before November 30.</p>
