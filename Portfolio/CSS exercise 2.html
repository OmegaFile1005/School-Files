    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>This week I am <i>extremely excited</i> about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide.</i> In
        <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in
        plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature
        you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>, Jeff
        Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.
    </p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a
        seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
